                <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Opportunity</h3>
                <p class="mb05">Customers who apply filters when shopping for outerwear are more satisfied post-purchase and ultimately spend more than those who don’t, but only a small percent of traffic engages with outerwear filters today.</p>

        <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Challenge</h3>

            <p class="mb05">15 current/potential A&F shoppers</p>
            <p class="mb05">All participants were recruited via IntelliZoom, the participant community of our user research platform, UserZoom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex-2">
            <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Demographics</h3>
            <ul class="work-list">
                <li>8 female, 7 male</li>
                <li>US only</li>

    <div style="margin: 1rem;">
                <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Discovery</h3>
                <p class="mb05">In the fall of 2019, Abercrombie introduced a seasonal visual filtering experience on the guys and girls outerwear category pages. This was designed by the marketing design team with no UX input at the time.</p>
                <p class="mb05">It was prominently displayed on the top of the page and the experience consisted of four attributes. Color, weight, lining, and features. Each of which contained a set of multi-selectable filters.</p>
                <p class="mb05">10% of page traffic that interacted with the filtering experience had a 2x higher revenue per visit  and higher CSAT(customer satisfaction scores) than those who did not. That data was pulled from the CX team and the analytics team.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Defining the Opportunity</h3>
        <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-1">
                <h4 class="work-copy mb05">Business Impact</h4>
                <p class="mb05">Customers who apply filters when shopping for outerwear ultimately spend more than those who don’t; however percent of traffic engaging with the filter is low.
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex-2">
                <h4 class="work-copy mb05">Customer Impact</h4>
                <p class="mb05">Customers who apply filters when shopping for outerwear are able to more easily find what they are looking for and are ultimately more satisfied with their experience.
                </p>
        </div>
</div>
<div style="margin: 1rem;">
                <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Hypothesis</h3>
                <p class="mb05">If we help customers understand their outerwear options and easily find what they are looking for then we will achieve higher filter engagement, revenue/visit, and customer satisfaction.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin: 1rem;">
                <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Research</h3>
                <h4 class="work-copy mb05">Based off data gathered from internal analytics we uncovered:</h4>
                <p class="mb05">Color was the most used visual filter, likely because it was the default filter in view upon the page entry.</p>
                <p class="mb05">Of the weight filters, mid-weight is the most frequently applied for both genders across all sites; however in EUUK there was higher interest in filtering down to heavyweight.</p>
                <p class="mb05">The lining filter was mostly used to narrow results to sherpa-lined items across both genders</p>
                <p class="mb05">Feature filter usage was similar across genders with water and down having the highest engagement and recycled fill having the lowest</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 1rem;">
                <h4 class="work-copy mb05">After compiling internal research, I conducted a series of qualitative surveys to understand the customer needs and motivations and to answer the following questions:</h4>
                <ul class="indent-list" style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>What is the customer mindset when shopping for outerwear?</li>
                <li>What attributes are most important when shopping for fashion outerwear vs. functional outerwear?</li>
                <li>What helps users understand how warm a product will be?</li>
                <li>How do users think about warmth vs. weight as product attributes?</li>
                </ul>
        </div>

        <div style="margin: 1rem;">
                <h4 class="work-copy mb05">Key Finding:</h4>
                <p class="mb05">Most users indicated they start their shopping experience with at least a general idea of what they’re looking for, but not necessarily a specific garment in mind.</p>
                <p class="mb05">Users are not likely to approach outerwear shopping with intention to just browse until they find something they like.</p>
                <p class="mb05">Shoppers prioritized color, style, and warmth (respectively) for fashion outerwear shopping, and warmth, machine washability, and water resistance for functional outerwear.</p>
                <p class="mb05">In the absence of temperature ratings, “material” was the most commonly used term to describe what aspects of a garment best translate to warmth, referring to both exterior fabric and inner lining.</p>
                <p class="mb05">Users also rely on product photos, reviews, and technical specs on the product page.</p>
                <p class="mb05">Users see warmth and weight as two separate attributes.</p>
                <p class="mb05">Most believe the heavier a coat is, the warmer it will be, but they also believe a lightweight or well-insulated material can provide ample warmth.</p>
        </div>


        <div style="margin: 1rem;">
                <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Business Goals</h3>
                <ul class="indent-list" style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Make filters findable and easy to understand and use.</li>
                <li>Limit filters to the most useful/important options</li>
                <li>Help customers understand the differences in outerwear attributes, like warmth/weight.</li>
                <li>Give users a quick way to reset selections or add/remove filters.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p class="mb05">After going over the initial findings and goals with the UX designers and using components available in the company's design system we wanted to test different filtering strategies for user understanding and preference.

                        <h4 class="work-copy mb05">Key findings</h4>
                        <p class="mb05">While users were receptive of the ’shop by style’ concept, 73% of participants would prefer to shop by attribute, driven mainly by male shoppers.</p>
                        <p class="mb05">However, users predict their preferences would change in different scenarios. When shopping for fashion outerwear or if shopping for something specific, they may prefer to shop by style.</p>
                        <p class="mb05"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Winning design:</span> shop by attribute</p>
                        <p class="mb05">While ‘shop by style’ or fashion/function seems to be a viable filtering strategy in some use cases, it does not meet the needs of users shopping for functional outerwear, who prioritizes several factors like warmth and technical features over product style.</p>
