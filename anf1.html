                    <p><i>"Confusing where warm scale was starting; filter said coats which makes me think it's winter specific but it's on the coats and jackets page and there were light jackets so maybe warm started with spring jacket warmth?"</i></p>

                    <p><i>"If I already has a winter jacket that suited my weather needs, and simply wanted another one for the aesthetics, then I would shop by style."</i></p>
