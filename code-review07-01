code review:

Meaghan: LOOOOOVe it!!! What more can I say?? The water color images are perfect. I love the animated shadow when you hover. Love the navigation from the individual reviews, and the list of countries - makes the site seamless. Adding & deleting tags works really well - excellent job! Love the color scheme. Very professional-looking! Great job, Summer :)

Mickey- I really liked the aesthetic and color scheme of your whole website. Everything was very easy to navigate through. Just the simple drop shadow on the home page made everything more interactive and great. AWESOMETASTIC!

Derek- Summer, your main page is AMAZING. I like your site.

Paige - great homepage - really nice job on the styling. Good naming in your app for the most part, easy to follow what is going on. One additional feature that would be nice is a navbar at the top linking you back to home, etc. well done!
