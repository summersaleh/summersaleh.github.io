                <h3 class="access-subtitle mb05">Project Overview</h3>
                <p class="mb05">At Connect for Health Colorado, the renewals process plays a crucial role in ensuring individuals and families maintain continuous health coverage. However, our research revealed that users faced confusion, anxiety, and uncertainty throughout the renewal experience, especially when interacting with the suggested plan renewals process.</p>
                <p class="mb05">As the UX Researcher on this project, my goal was to identify friction points, uncover user expectations, and enhance the Suggested Plans feature for a more transparent, intuitive, and reassuring renewal experience.</p>

        <p class="mb05">Many users didn't seem to remember the welcome page that much indicating that they
                don't or didn't interact with it much. There was confusion on the expected functionality of
                the CTAs on the page with users giving mixed responses on what would happen if they
                were to select one. The copy of the page was unclear and there was a comment on the
                color of the open enrollment.</p>

                        <li>View application was seen as a place to view all current and past applications by
                                some users. One user thought that 'View Application' was where they could make
                                changes to their application.</li>
