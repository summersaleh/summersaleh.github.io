<article>
<p>Hi! I'm Summer. I love good content, learning new things, and coding.</p> 

<p>Currently, I am a student at We Can Code It, a boot camp focused on full-stack development with a focus in Java. I am a recent graduate from The Ohio State University with majors in Geography and International studies. I valued my undergraduate education and I wanted to get into a field that encourages change and agility as well as a chance to collaborate and be innovative.  I am excited to pursue a career in software development so that I can use technology to apply my critical thinking skills in a real way.</p>

<p>My development skills include: Development Skills: Java • Spring • Hibernate • JavaScript • jQuery • HTML5 • CSS3 • Bootstrap • MVC • Responsive Design / Mobile • Structured Query Language (SQL) • Transactional Databases / MSSQL • Object Oriented • Source Control / Git</p>

<p>When I'm not making magic at my desk, you're likely to find me exploring nature, eating my way through Columbus, or taking in the beautiful sites of the city.</p>
