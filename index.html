<!-- About Me -->
<p>Hi! I'm Summer. I love good content, creativeCurrently, I am a student at We Can Code It, a boot camp focused on full-stack development with a focus in Java. I am a recent graduate from The Ohio State University with majors in Geography and International studies. I valued my undergraduate education and I wanted to get into a field that encourages change and agility as well as a chance to collaborate and be innovative.  I am excited to pursue a career in software development so that I can use technology to apply my critical thinking skills in a real way.</p>
